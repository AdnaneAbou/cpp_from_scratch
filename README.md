# C++ From Scratch

"C++ From Scratch" is an introductory course on programming with C++. It covers the essential parts of C++ without becomming an exhaustive references on every operator, algorithm, and data structure available in C++ and through the standard library.

## Audience

This course is suitable for both self-motivated new programmers, and experienced programmers that want to learn about modern C++.

The course should provide new programmers with an entry-point to C++, and give this a guide of where to learn about the different parts of the language in a logical order.

The course should provide experienced programmers with a clear and concise overview of the language, with pointers to the reference material where they can learn more about the topics they are interested in.
